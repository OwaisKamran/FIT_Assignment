My name is Owais Kamran, and I am currently enrolled in the BC-IT program at NED University.I completed my schooling at Stanmore Public School and 
my intermediate studies at Adamjee Government Science College, Karachi. My decision to pursue a career in computer science stems from my strong 
interest in coding and all things tech-related. Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring new technologies and playing badminton.
